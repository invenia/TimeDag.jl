"""
Represent a graph of nodes which doesn't hold strong references to any nodes.

This is useful, as it allows the existence of this graph to be somewhat transparent to the
user, and they only have to care about holding on to references for nodes that they care
about.

Note that this structure is definitely *not* threadsafe. We are assuming that all nodes are
created in a single thread.
